> **This repository is for educational purposes 📚**

I'm purposely using this name conventions from Mr. Robot TV show ([see ref. table](#table "Goto table")), so that it's hard for users to find my solutions on Google.  
But if you found this repo, then you're probably one of these people:
- [ ] You just spent too much time watching Mr. Robot, Bonsoir Eliot 🙋🏻‍♂️
- [ ] You are desperately looking for solutions of a kata
- [ ] You just surf GitHub all day, every day 
- [ ] All the above


## ⚠️ DISCLAIMER ⚠️

- ⛔️ Plagiarism may cause loss of points (honors) or a complete termination of the account.
- ⛔️ Submitting my or other user's solutions on Codewars as your own will be considered as plagiarism.
- ⛔️ Without solving the challenges (katas) on your own, checking the solution is strongly discouraged.

## Introduction


> Hi I'm Ken 👨🏻‍💻, I'm a Front-End developer and JS 🟨 nerd. I have been solving challanges on Codewars since the beginning of my learning journey. I've created this repository for educational purposes, as well as to show my skills in JS. I hope I can teach you some new JS skills and tricks. As mentioned above it's discouraged to check the answers before solving the challenge (kata) on your own, because at the end of the day you're trying to practice and learn something. So I wish you happy coding and hope you enjoy your programming journey! 👾
