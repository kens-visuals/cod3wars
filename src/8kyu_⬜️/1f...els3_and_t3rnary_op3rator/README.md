# Description

In JavaScript, `if..else` is the most basic condition statement, it consists of three parts:`condition, statement1, statement2`, like this:

```javascript
if (condition) statement_A;
else statement_B;
```

It means that if the condition is true, then execute the statement_A, otherwise execute the statement_B. If the statemen_A or statement_B more than one line, you need to add `{` and `}` at the head and tail of statement in JS, to keep the same indentation in Python and to put an `end` in Ruby where it indeed ends.

For example, if we want to decide whether a number is odd or even, we can write code like this:

```javascript
function oddEven(n) {
  if (n % 2 == 1) return "odd number";
  else return "even number";
}
```

If there is more than one condition to check, we can use the compound if...else statement.

For example:

```javascript
function oldYoung(age) {
  if (age < 16) return "children";
  else if (age < 50) return "young man";
  //use "else if" if needed
  else return "old man";
}
```

This function returns a different value depending on the parameter age.

Looks very complicated? Well, JS and Ruby also support the `ternary operator` and Python has something similar too:

```javascript
condition ? statementa : statementb;
```

Condition and statement separated by "?", different statement separated by ":" in both Ruby and JS; in Python you put the condition in the middle of two alternatives. The two examples above can be simplified with ternary operator:

```javascript
function oddEven(n) {
  return n % 2 == 1 ? "odd number" : "even number";
}

function oldYoung(age) {
  return age < 16 ? "children" : age < 50 ? "young man" : "old man";
}
```

# Task:

Complete function `saleHotdogs`/`SaleHotDogs`/`sale_hotdogs`, function accepts 1 parameters:`n`, n is the number of customers to buy hot dogs, different numbers have different prices (refer to the following table), return a number that the customer need to pay how much money.

```
+---------------+-------------+
|  numbers n    | price(cents)|
+---------------+-------------+
|n<5            |    100      |
+---------------+-------------+
|n>=5 and n<10  |     95      |
+---------------+-------------+
|n>=10          |     90      |
+---------------+-------------+
```

NOTE: You can use ifâ€¦else or ternary operator to complete it.
