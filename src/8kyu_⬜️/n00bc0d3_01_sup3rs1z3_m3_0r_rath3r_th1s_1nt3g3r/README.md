# Description

Write a function that rearranges an integer into its largest possible value.

Example (**Input** ⇒ **Output**)

```
123456 --> 654321
105 --> 510
12 --> 21
```

If the argument passed through is a single digit or is already the maximum possible integer, your function should simply return it.
