# Description

In JavaScript, String is one of the basic data types. Use `""` or `''` to declare a string variable. It can be:

- Letters: `a,b,c,A,B,C,`
- Numbers: `123...`
- Various symbol: `@#$%^&\*`
- Control symbol: `\n,\t` etc.

String can use operators `+` to connect two or more strings together.
