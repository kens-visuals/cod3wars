# Trolls are attacking your comment section!

> A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.

# TASK
### Write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.

For example

```js
disemvowel("This website is for losers LOL!"); // "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".
```

Note: for this kata y isn't considered a vowel.
