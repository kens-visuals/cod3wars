# Description

Your task is to make a function, which returns the sum of a sequence of integers.

The sequence is defined by 3 non-negative values: **begin**, **end**, **step**.

If **begin** value is greater than the **end**, the function should return **0**

_Examples_

```javascript
sequenceSum(2, 2, 2) === 2;
sequenceSum(2, 6, 2) === 12; // 2 + 4 + 6
sequenceSum(1, 5, 1) === 15; // 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5
sequenceSum(1, 5, 3) === 5; // 1 + 4
```
