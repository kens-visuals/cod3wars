# Description

In this Kata, we are going to reverse a string while maintaining the spaces (if any) in their original place.

For example:

```js
solve("our code") = "edo cruo";
// -- Normal reversal without spaces is "edocruo".
// -- However, there is a space at index 3, so the string becomes "edo cruo"

solve("your code rocks") = "skco redo cruoy".solve("codewars") = "srawedoc";
```

More examples in the test cases. All input will be lowercase letters and in some cases spaces.

Good luck!
