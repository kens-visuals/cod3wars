# Description

Zalgo text is text that leaks into our plane of existence from a corrupted dimension of Unicode. For example:

```
H̗̪͇͓̙͎̣̄ͬa͚̯̦͉̖̥v͆ͩ̃͆̓̐ͥe̟͎͖͕͍̎ ̰͚̩̟͕̰͊̽̍ͯ̌͊ā̖̪͉͍̥͙̿ͩ̃ͅ ̬̥͎͑̿ͧg̰̳̺͔̦͉ͫ̀̐̓̐r̝̫̱̘̰͐͋ͯͭͭͭ͆e͙͕̖̗͙̰͌ͭä͓͚̝͓́̌͑ͪ͊ṱͥ ̱ͣd͎͔͎͇̫̪̘̃͐̇à͕̮̈͋ͪy̼̳̱ͮ!̳̥̰̭͇̔ͮ̽̓
```

Complete the function that converts a string of Zalgo text into a string interpretable by our mortal eyes. For example, the string above would be converted into:

```
Have a great day!
```

The converted string should only feature ASCII characters.
