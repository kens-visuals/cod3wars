# Description

If you finish this kata, you can try [Insane Colored Triangles](http://www.codewars.com/kata/insane-coloured-triangles) by Bubbler, which is a _**much**_ harder version of this one.

A colored triangle is created from a row of colors, each of which is red, green or blue. Successive rows, each containing one fewer color than the last, are generated by considering the two touching colors in the previous row. If these colors are identical, the same color is used in the new row. If they are different, the missing color is used in the new row. This is continued until the final row, with only a single color, is generated.

The different possibilities are:

```
Colour here:        G G        B G        R G        B R
Becomes colour:      G          R          B          G

```

With a bigger example:

```
R R G B R G B B
 R B R G B R B
  G G B R G G
   G R G B G
    B B R R
     B G R
      R B
       G
```

You will be given the first row of the triangle as a string and its your job to return the final color which would appear in the bottom row as a string. In the case of the example above, you would the given `RRGBRGBB` you should return `G`.

- The input string will only contain the uppercase letters `R, G, B` and there will be at least one letter, so you do not have to test for invalid input.
- If you are only given one color as the input, return that color.
