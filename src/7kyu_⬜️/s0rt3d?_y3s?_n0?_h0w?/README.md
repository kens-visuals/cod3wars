# Description

Complete the method, which accepts an array of integers, and returns one of the following:

- `"yes, ascending"` - if the numbers in the array are sorted in ascending order
- `"yes, descending"` - if the numbers in the array are sorted in descending order
- `"no"` - otherwise

You can assume the array will always be valid, and there will always be one correct answer.
