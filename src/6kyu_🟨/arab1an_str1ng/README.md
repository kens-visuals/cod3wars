# Description

You must create a method that can convert a string from any format into Pascal Case. This must support symbols too.

_Don't presume the separators too much, or you could be surprised._

For example: (**Input --> Output**)

```
"example name" --> "ExampleName"
"your-NaMe-here" --> "YourNameHere"
"testing ABC" --> "TestingAbc"
```
