# Description

You are given a string of numbers between 0-9. Find the average of these numbers and return it as a floored whole number (i.e.: no decimal places) written out as a string. E.G.:

"zero nine five two" â‡’ "four"

If the string is empty or includes a number greater than 9, return "n/a"
