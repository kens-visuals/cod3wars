# Description

Make me a window. I'll give you a number (N). You return a window.

Rules:

The window will always be 2 x 2.

The window needs to have N number of periods across and N number of periods vertically in each pane.

Example:

```
N = 3

---------
|...|...|
|...|...|
|...|...|
|---+---|
|...|...|
|...|...|
|...|...|
---------
```

Note: there should be no trailing new line characters at the end.
