# Description

Given two arrays of integers, find the pair of values with the smallest difference and return that difference.

If both arrays are empty, return -1.

If one array is empty, return the smallest value from the non-empty array.

Note: Try to solve this without brute force.

```
Example:

  arr1 = [1, 3, 5, 23, 5]
  arr2 = [45, 34, 67, 2, 0]

  Output = 1

Example empty array:

  arr1 = [1, 3, 5, 23, 5]
  arr2 = []

  Output = 1

Example two empty arrays:

  arr1 = []
  arr2 = []

  Output = -1
```
